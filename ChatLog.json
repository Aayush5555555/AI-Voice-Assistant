The operation aimed at Jaish-e-Mohammed and other terrorist organizations.\n\nThe Indian military, including the Border Security Force (BSF), inflicted significant damage on terrorist infrastructure and Pakistani positions along the International Border. A video released by the BSF shows Pakistani soldiers fleeing during the operation.\n\nThe operation is reported to have caused substantial damage to the Pakistani air force, with some estimates suggesting it may take them five years to recover. The Indian military, including women personnel, played a key role in the operation, targeting Pakistani border posts and launchpads.\n\nFor the most up-to-date information, I recommend checking reputable news sources such as the Times of India."
